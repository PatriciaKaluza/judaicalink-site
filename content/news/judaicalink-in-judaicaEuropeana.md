The second phase of the Judaica-Europeana (www.judaica-europeana.eu) has been selected for funding by the Innovation and Networks Executive Agency (INEA) of the European Commission. 
Judaica Europeana 2.0 continues the aggregation of Jewish heritage materials and fundamentally improving the quality of aggregated metadata and digital objects. 
JudaicaLink will collaborate by providing a knowledge graph for contextualization. We look forward to our further collaborations.
