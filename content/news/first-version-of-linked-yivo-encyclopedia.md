+++

We are very happy to announce the first release of the <a hraf="http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/">YIVO Encyclopedia</a> as Linked Open Data. This first release is merely for demonstration. If you want to have a look, here is the concept YIVO: http://data.judaicalink.org/data/yivo/YIVO

While browsing the YIVO Encyclopedia, you can access the data representation by simply replacing www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/ with data.judaicalink.org/data/yivo/ in the URL field of your browser. For convenience, you can also use this bookmarklet:

YIVO LOD (Drag and drop this link to your bookmarks)

If you click this bookmarklet in your bookmarks while on a YIVO article, you will directly reach the Linked Data version of the same article. Have fun browsing around and let us know what you think.

Update: We also opened our <a href="http://data.judaicalink.org/sparql/query">SPARQL endpoint</a> for you! And here is a <a href="http://data.judaicalink.org/sparql/form.html">query form</a> for your convenience.

Update 2: The crawler is available at GitHub, please use our <a href="https://github.com/kaiec/judaicalink-crawler/issues">issue tracker</a> to communicate any problems with the data.
