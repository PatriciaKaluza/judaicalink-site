+++

With the continues efforts of our team towards expanding JudaicaLink datasets and resources, 
another dataset, Biographisches Handbuch der Rabbiner (Biographical handbook of Rabbis) has been 
added to JudaicaLink. 
 
The Biographisches Handbuch der Rabbiner is an online encyclopedia provided by the 
[Salomon L. Steinheim-Institute for German-Jewish history](http://www.steinheim-institut.de) at 
the University of Duisburg-Essen, edited by Michael Brocke and Julius Carlebach.

This dataset currently contains 2900 persons, with their names, date and place of birth and death, 
GND-ID, and occupation when available.  

All the extraction and data generation python codes are available open source on our 
Github <a href="https://github.com/wisslab/judaicalink-loader/">repository</a>. 
In the resulted RDF files the persons and their corresponding attributes were 
mapped to the JudaicaLink ontology. 

The datasets data can also be accessed directly via our 
SPARQL <a href="http://data.judaicalink.org/sparql.html">endpoint</a>.  
More details on all the JudaicaLink datasets can be 
found <a href="http://www.judaicalink.org/datasets/">here</a>.
