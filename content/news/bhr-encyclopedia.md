+++

With the continues efforts of our team towards expanding JudaicaLink datasets and resources, another dataset, Biographisches Handbuch der Rabbiner (The Bibliography of Rabbis) is added to JudaicaLink. 
 
The Biographisches Handbuch der Rabbiner is an online encyclopaedia created by Steinheim Institute. This encyclopaedia consists of two volumes. Volume 1 contains the rabbis of the Emancipation Period in the German, Bohemian and large Polish countries in 1781-1871 and is edited by Carsten Wilke. Volume 2 contains the rabbis in the German Reich in 1871-1945 and is edited by Katrin Nele Jansen.

This dataset contains 2900 persons, with their names, date and place of birth and death, GND-ID, and occupation when available.  

All the extraction and data generation python codes are available open source on our Github <a href="https://github.com/wisslab/judaicalink-loader/">repository</a>. 
In the resulted RDF files the persons and their corresponding attributes were mapped to JudaicaLink ontology. 
The datasets data can also be accessed directly via our SPARQL <a href="http://data.judaicalink.org/sparql.html">endpoint</a>.
